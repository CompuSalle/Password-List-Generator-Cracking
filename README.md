> Program Explanation

Overall, the rainbow table generate function (step 1) can create a password combination, or as per
of (numbers – lowercase – uppercase – symbols) as user-chosen, the password list length can also
be chosen by the user, the password will then be generated and saved in a (txt) file. 

The algorithm for part **A** is as explained:
- Ask the user if he wants to generate a password table or brute-force a code.
- Asking the user to input the needed combination for his list. (One combination, e.g. onlynumbers), (two combinations, e.g. numbers and lowercase).
- Asking the user to insert the password length, min length, and max length.
- Asking the user if he wants to display the output on the screen
- Saving the result into (txt) file

Part **B**: 

A function has been created to take the user input (password) and brute force it using a pre-created
rainbow table; the user should insert the rainbow table directory name to be able to use it.
